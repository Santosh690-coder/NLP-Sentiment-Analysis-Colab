# Natural Language Processing for Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a sentiment analysis model built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify text (e.g., movie reviews, product comments) as having a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

## Key Features
* **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques for cleaning and preparing text data.
* **Model Training:** Fine-tuning a pre-trained Transformer model (e.g., DistilBERT) for sentiment classification.
* **Sentiment Prediction:** Ability to predict the sentiment of new, unseen text.
* **Google Colab Integration:** The entire project is developed and runnable in Google Colab, leveraging its free GPU/TPU resources.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Google Colaboratory
* Hugging Face Transformers library
* Tensorflow
* Pandas (for data handling)
* Scikit-learn (for evaluation metrics)

## How to Run This Project in Google Colab

1.  **Open the Notebook:** Click the "Open in Colab" badge below to open the notebook directly in Google Colab.
    [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Santosh690-coder/NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-Colab/blob/main/NLP_for_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb)
2.  **Change Runtime Type:** In Colab, go to `Runtime` > `Change runtime type` and select `GPU` as the hardware accelerator.
3.  **Run All Cells:** Go to `Runtime` > `Run all` to execute the entire notebook. This will install necessary libraries, load data, train the model, and demonstrate predictions.

## Dataset
 This project uses the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) dataset for movie reviews.

## Results and Evaluation

The model achieved an accuracy of more than 90% on the test set. Here are some example predictions:
* "This product is amazing!" -> Positive
* "It was okay, but could be better." -> Neutral
* "Absolutely terrible experience." -> Negative
